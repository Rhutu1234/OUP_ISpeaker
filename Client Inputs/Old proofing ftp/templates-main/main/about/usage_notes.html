        <dt class="hide">Where are the usage notes in the dictionary entries?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p><span>The usage notes are collapsed by default in dictionary entries, and at first you will see the Usage Note heading only, with a &quot;+&quot; symbol next to it. For example at the entry for <a href="#skLicensedUrl('/definition/english/job_1')">job</a>,  there are several notes including a synonyms and a collocations note. Clicking or tapping on any of these will expand the full note, and clicking or tapping again will close it.</span></p>
        </dd>
        
        <dt class="hide">How can I use the Usage Notes to expand my vocabulary?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Our usage notes are an excellent way to expand your vocabulary, because they contain lots of information about how different words and phrases are really used in everyday English. They usually contain extra example phrases or sentences, and they often compare groups of words to show you similarities and differences.</p>
            <p>You will find that more frequent and useful words, such as the words on the Oxford 3000 list, often contain more than one usage note, so these entries are a good place to look for further information if you are writing an essay in English, or if you are preparing for an English exam.</p>
